# Multi-Brain: Unified segmentation of population neuroimaging data

## Overview
This repository contains the Multi-Brain (MB) model, which has the general aim of integrating a number of disparate image analysis components within a single unified generative modelling framework (segmentation, nonlinear registration, image translation, etc.). The model is described in Brudfors et al [2020], and it builds on a number of previous works. Its objective is to achieve diffeomorphic alignment of a wide variaty of medical image modalities into a common anatomical space. This involves the ability to construct a "tissue probability template" from a population of scans through group-wise alignment [Ashburner & Friston, 2009; Blaiotta et al, 2018]. Diffeomorphic deformations are computed within a *geodesic shooting* framework [Ashburner & Friston, 2011], which is optimised with a Gauss-Newton strategy that uses a multi-grid approach to solve the system of linear equations [Ashburner, 2007]. Variability among image contrasts is modelled using a much more sophisticated version of the Gaussian mixture model with bias correction framework originally proposed by Ashburner & Friston [2005], and which has been extended to account for known variability of the intensity distributions of different tissues [Blaiotta et al, 2018]. This model has been shown to provide a good model of the intensity distributions of different imaging modalities [Brudfors et al, 2019]. Time permitting, additional registration accuracy through the use of shape variability priors [Balbastre et al, 2018] will also be incorporated.

## Dependencies
The algorithm is developed using MATLAB and relies on external functionality from the SPM12 software:
* **SPM12:** Download from https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/.
* **Shoot toolbox:** Add Shoot folder from the toolbox directory of the SPM source code.
* **Longitudinal toolbox:** Add Longitudinal folder from the toolbox directory of the SPM source code.

## Example use cases
This section contains example code demonstrating how the MB toolbox can be used for nonlinear image registration, spatial normalisation, tissue segmentation and bias-field correction. **Example 1** learns (or fits) the MB model from a population of MRI scans. Learning the MB model results in a bunch of tissue segmentations, bias-field corrected scans and forward deformations, aligning a template to each subject's scan (a combined nonlinear and rigid registration). The deformations can be used to warp a subject image to template space, or aligning two subjects' images together by composing their deformations. These two operations are demonstrated in **Example 2**. Finally, **Example 3** fits an already learned MB model to two subject MRIs. This is equivalent to registering to a pre-existing common space. Warping can then be done as shown in Example 2.

### 1. Learning the MB model
``` matlab
% This script fits the MB model to a population of MRIs. It is a
% group-wise image registration where an optimal K class tissue template is 
% built, as well as optimal intensity parameters learnt. The resulting
% deformations (written to dir_out prefixed y_) can then be used to warp
% between subject scans. Also native and template space tissue
% segmentaitons are written to disk, as well as a bias-field corrected 
% versions of the input scans.

% Data directory, assumed to contain MRI nifti images of the same contrast.
dir_data = '/directory/with/some/MRIs';

% Get paths to data
pth_im  = spm_select('FPList',dir_data,'^.*\.nii$'); % Selects all nifti files in dir_data

% RUN module (fits  the model)
run              = struct;
run.mu.create.K  = 5;                        % Number of classes in the TPMs. The actual TPMs will contain one more (implicit) class
run.mu.create.vx = 1.5;                      % Voxel size of the template -> smaller == faster, but less precise
run.onam         = 'mb_test';                % A name for the model
run.odir         = {'mb-output'};            % Output directory (to write model files)
run.nworker      = Inf;                      % Number of parallel workers
run.save         = true;                     % Save model at each 'epoch'
run.gmm(1).chan(1).images = cellstr(pth_im); % Image files

% OUT module (writes different outputs)
out        = struct;
out.result = {fullfile(run.odir{1},  ['mb_fit_' run.onam '.mat'])};
out.c      = true(1, run.mu.create.K + 1);  % write classes in native space
out.wc     = true(1, run.mu.create.K + 1);  % write classes in template space
out.mwc    = true(1, run.mu.create.K + 1);  % write classes in modulated template space
out.sm     = true(1, run.mu.create.K + 1);  % write scalar momentum

% Run jobs
jobs{1}.spm.tools.mb.run = run;
jobs{2}.spm.tools.mb.out = out;
spm_jobman('run', jobs);
```

### 2. Warping with MB deformations
``` matlab
% This script demonstrates warping with the deformation generated from
% fitting the MB model. The template file generated by MB, plus two subject 
% scans with their corresponding forward deformations (prefixed 'y_') are
% needed. The following three warps are demonstrated:
% 1. Warp an image to template space.
% 2. Warp the template to image space.
% 3. Warp one image to another image.

% Path to a MB tissue template (this is dir_out in Example 1)
pth_mu = fullfile(dir_out,'mu_mb_test.nii');
% Paths to two subject MRIs to which MB has been fitted
pth_img1 = '/directory/with/some/MRIs/img1.nii';
pth_img2 = '/directory/with/some/MRIs/img2.nii';
% Paths to corresponding forward deformations of the above subjects
pth_y1 = fullfile(dir_out,'/y_img1.nii');
pth_y2 = fullfile(dir_out,'y_img2.nii');
% Where to write the warped images
dir_out = 'warped';

% 1. Use forward deformation (pth_y1) to warp image 1 (pth_img1) to 
%    template space (pth_mu)
% -----------------
matlabbatch = {};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.comp{1}.inv.comp{1}.def     = {pth_y1};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.comp{1}.inv.space           = {pth_mu};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.fnames          = {pth_img1};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.savedir.saveusr = {dir_out};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.interp          = 1;
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.mask            = 1;
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.fwhm            = [0 0 0];
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.prefix          = 'w';
spm_jobman('run',matlabbatch);

% 2. Use forward deformation (pth_y1) to template (pth_mu) to  image 
%    space (pth_img1) 
% -----------------
matlabbatch = {};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.comp{1}.comp{1}.def         = {pth_y1};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.comp{1}.space               = {pth_img1};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.fnames          = {pth_mu};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.savedir.saveusr = {dir_out};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.interp          = 1;
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.mask            = 1;
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.fwhm            = [0 0 0];
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.prefix          = 'w';
spm_jobman('run',matlabbatch);

% 3. Compose both forward deformations (pth_y1, pth_y2) via template space
%    to register image 2 (pth_img2) to image 1 (pth_img1).
% -----------------
matlabbatch = {};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.comp{1}.inv.comp{1}.def     = {pth_y2};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.comp{1}.inv.space           = {pth_mu};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.comp{2}.def                 = {pth_y1};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.fnames          = {pth_img2};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.savedir.saveusr = {dir_out};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.interp          = 1;
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.mask            = 1;
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.fwhm            = [0 0 0];
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.prefix          = 'w';
spm_jobman('run',matlabbatch);
```

### 3. Fitting a learned MB model
``` matlab
% This script demonstrates how to fit a learned MB model (template and 
% intensity prior) to new data. In practice, it only involves modifying
% some settings in Example 1.

% Path to results MAT-file generated by fitting MB
pth_fit = fullfile(dir_out,'mb_fit_mb_test.mat');

% Make intensity prior file by extracting information from pth_fit
load(pth_fit,'sett'); 
pr      = sett.gmm.pr; 
mg_ix   = sett.gmm.mg_ix; 
save('prior_mb.mat','pr','mg_ix');

% Add the following fields to the RUN module of Example 1:
run.mu.exist    = {pth_mu};
run.gmm.pr.file = {pth_int_prior};
% and remove run.mu.create.K and run.mu.create.vx
```
